    <h1>Welcome to M&T's lemonade stand where our snacks are freshly made everyday with love.


        We are a brother and sister team (assisted by our mother) selling fresh lemonade and home made Mandazi (African donuts) 
                to friends and neigbours. Our busness was born out of severe boredom, the love of our mom's yummy mandazi and the need to earn spending money.
                 Mandazi are a very popular EastAfrican snack or dessert commonly servered with ginger-Tea or a glass of milk. 
                 our case we pare them with fresh lemonade. If it was up to us we would have a bakesale every week, 
                 but we are happy to have one whenever our mom is available to help. We have been in business for over 5 years.
